// auth.js

/**
 * This module implements a basic authentication system with hardcoded user profiles
 * and roles for demonstration purposes. It is designed to simulate user login,
 * logout, and role management in a simple application. The current implementation
 * is not secure and serves as a placeholder for a future upgrade that can include
 * real authentication using SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) and AWS Cognito
 * for identity management.
 *
 * For demo purposes:
 * - User authentication is implemented using hardcoded user profiles (editor, viewer, admin).
 * - These profiles have simple, insecure passwords stored in plain text, and there is no
 *   real security applied.
 * - The role-based access control is simulated using a state variable, but this logic
 *   can be extended with actual authentication and authorization techniques in a production
 *   environment.
 *
 * Placeholder for future authentication:
 * - In a real-world application, SAML-based authentication would be implemented
 *   to securely manage user identities and allow Single Sign-On (SSO) across platforms.
 * - AWS Cognito could be integrated to handle user pools, manage authentication flows,
 *   and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA), improving security for production use.
 * - The login logic in this module would be replaced by actual authentication mechanisms
 *   using tokens (JWTs) and identity assertions obtained from an Identity Provider (IdP).
 *
 * This code can be refactored to replace the hardcoded authentication with AWS Cognito
 * and SAML by following the guidelines outlined in the attached document.

/**
 * Future SAML Authentication Implementation (Commented Out):
 *
 * For a real-world production upgrade, the following steps can be taken:
 * 1. Replace the hardcoded users with AWS Cognito for user management:
 *    - Use Cognito user pools to store and manage users, their credentials, and roles.
 * 2. Implement SAML authentication using an external Identity Provider (IdP):
 *    - SAML assertions would be sent to the application after successful user authentication.
 *    - The IdP (e.g., Okta, AWS SSO) would handle user login and provide an identity token
 *      that includes user roles and permissions.
 * 3. Verify the SAML token and extract the user's role for role-based access control.
 * 4. Handle multi-factor authentication (MFA) if required.
 *
 * Example Code Snippet for Cognito/SAML integration (future upgrade):
 *
 * import { Auth } from 'aws-amplify'; // Import AWS Amplify library
 *
 * async function login(username, password) {
 *     try {
 *         const user = await Auth.signIn(username, password); // Cognito authentication
 *         const role = user.signInUserSession.accessToken.payload['cognito:groups'][0]; // Extract role
 *         setLoggedIn(true);
 *         setUserRole(role);
 *         setError('');
 *     } catch (error) {
 *         setError("Login failed: " + error.message);
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * async function logout() {
 *     try {
 *         await Auth.signOut(); // Cognito sign out
 *         setLoggedIn(false);
 *         setUserRole('');
 *     } catch (error) {
 *         setError("Logout failed: " + error.message);
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * Note: This is a simplified example. In a real implementation, there would be more handling
 * for session management, error handling, and security measures like token expiration and refresh.
